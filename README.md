**Please do not push into master branch. A new version is deployed to heroku each time a push is done. Use [dev](https://github.com/Nearsoft/questions/tree/dev) or any other branch.**

## Team

Check our contributors and ask [any of us](https://github.com/Nearsoft/questions/graphs/contributors) if you want to help.

## Why ?
Itâ€™s not easy to find answers to internal and technical questions inside a team project, as well as questions regarding internal process of the company.

## Sample problem we'd like to solve:
 - Offer validated answers faster, within a centralized database.
 - Minimize the time users spent asking other people, or searching the answer of their question.

## Phase 1 / Free Hack Day - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on Nov 2015
Our first prototype is focused on showing suggestion of questions the user ask, and how to create a new question if the user couldn't find his question. Answering questions is also a feature.

### Technology used to reach the goal
 - Spring Boot (Spring MVC, Profiling, Global Exception Handling)
 - Spring Data
 - PostgreSQL
 - Hibernate for entities management
 - Hibernate Search (still pending to define)
 - React JS as front end framework

You can see the [prototype online](https://protected-refuge-1912.herokuapp.com/).
