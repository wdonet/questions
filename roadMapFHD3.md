## Executive Summary
We analyzed interests in several selected people around all offices at Nearsoft and found that the majority of us might have concurrent and varied questions about finance stuff.

We need to achieve the following:
 - Offer validated answers faster, within a centralized database.
 - Minimize the time users spent asking other people, or searching the right answer to certain questions each time.


#### The problem
Itâ€™s not easy to find answers to questions of internal processes of the company or even to internal and technical questions inside a team project.

#### Solution
We would like to:
 - Build a cool application that leads us find those answers quickly.
 - Freeing people in charge of processes of being asked with the same question by a different person each time.
 - Find a way to centralize results for new hired persons.

## Goal for the prototype

#### Current system
Our first prototype was focused on the ability in the application to add questions, to list them, classify them by tags and be able to answer them.

#### Promise of Prototype
We have several goals:
 - Show suggestions of questions when the user is asking.
 - The user should be able to add new question easily if his question is not found
 - Have a visual way to track/show who's questioning and who's answering.
 - The user should be able to find unanswered/newest questions and go through a correct pagination
 - The user should be able to find questions by tag

## User Description
The application can be used by *any at Nearsoft* to answer first, finance questions, then others related to initiatives, internal teams, general and common processes.
